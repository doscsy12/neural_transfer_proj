# Performing neural style transfer on artwork
This is a mini-project that uses deep learning to compose one image in the style of another image (ie., neural style transfer). This technique was outlined in A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style ([Gatys et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)). 

Later methods have been introduced to improve the algorithms so as to produce more complex artistic styles, such as the techniques outlined by [Novak and Nikulin,2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04603)
