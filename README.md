# Performing neural style transfer on artwork
This is a mini-project that uses deep learning to compose one image in the style of another image (ie., neural style transfer). This technique was outlined in A Neural Algorithm of Artistic Style ([Gatys et al. 2015](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576)). 

Later studies have introduced methods to improve the algorithms so as to produce more complex styles, such as the techniques outlined by [Novak and Nikulin, 2016](https://arxiv.org/abs/1605.04603). A review of artistic style transfer using deep learning can be found here by [Jing et al., 2019](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8732370).
